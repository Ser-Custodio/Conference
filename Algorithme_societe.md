## Algorithmes and society: transparency of online publicity

Speaker : Patrick Loiseau (Society: Laboratoire d'informatique de Grenoble)

Date : January 24th 2018 - Festival TRANSFO

### Context

In 2017, Facebook claim 2 billion active users per month. Facebook business model relys on publicity(advertisement) as source of income.

Therefore Facebook's goal is that the publicity is precisely targeted to be more efficient and profitable.

### Data gathering

Data today is an important economic issue for all advertisers. They are collecting more and more data to further target their audience in order to increase their turnover.
For example, loyalty cards allow brands and to retrieve accurate data on the purchasing behavior of their customers.
Thus brands can provide customers with targeted offers that will be more likely to trigger the purchase from their customers.

In order to target advertising audiences, Facebook retrieves a multitude of data:
* Facebook actions (posts, likes, comments)
* Browser actions (sites visited other than Facebook)
* Offline data: these data are bought from *Data Brokers*

*Data Brokers: a company whose business is based on the resale of data to advertisers*
*Facebook Data Brokers:*
- Epsilon, Acxiom, and Datalogix

These companies have access to trillions of data transactions each year. Acxiom executives have stated that their database alone contains information about 500 million active consumers worldwide, with an average of 1,500 data points per person.

### Target Facebook advertisements

Facebook allows advertisers to target their audience via two models:

##### Attribute targeting

The announcers can choosefrom hundreds of attributes to target their audience

 For example, an advertiser for a brand of women's sportswear, can target their audience with the attributes:
* "lives in a city of more than 50,000 inhabitants"
* "love the sport"
* "housewife"...

##### Direct targeting

Advertisers can directly enter a list of emails (emails from people with an account on their website for example) or a list of phone numbers.

Facebook then matches this list to those of their users. Advertising will then only be visible to targeted user accounts.

### The major challenges of advertising

The targeting of online advertising is facing major challenges.

#### Respect for privacy:

Until December 2017, it was possible to find personal information about a Facebook user by exploiting the "Potential Reach".

Potential Reach shows the number of people targeted when an advertiser sets up an ad.

In fact, the advertiser by crossing the data during targeting can with an email address find the account of the user or even his phone number (info that can be collected by Facebook).

In addition, any Facebook user can become an advertiser and use this targeting for more or less honest purposes.

Respect for the privacy of the user is therefore clearly challenged with this "flaw".

#### Fight against discrimination:

Certain attributes or the use of corrolated attributes can become a real discrimination against communities.

Until 2016, Facebook offered on the United States an attribute "Ethnic Affinity" which indicated the ethnic origin of the user.
Despite the removal of this attribute, which is clearly discriminatory, advertisers can use the correlation of several attributes to exclude a community from their advertising targeting.

For example, a real estate agency based in Grenoble wants to transmit its advertising only to a hearing of white people.
The agency can exclude from the audience people who "love Gospel" in Grenoble (use of correlated attributes to obtain ethnic targeting).
In order to comply with French law, the agency will open its targeting to all these people but in Paris.
Thus, the agency complies with French laws, while ensuring a targeted audience according to its criteria on Grenoble. Parisians are not interested in a real estate in Grenoble.

Some attributes may therefore favor discrimination based on ethnicity or sexual orientation.

#### Transparency:

Following numerous alerts from specialists on the lack of transparency of targeting, Facebook has taken a step in this direction.

Facebook allows you to view the criteria that were used to target us when an advertisement appears on our news feed.
However, we do not know all the criteria that have been selected by the advertiser when targeting his advertising.

In fact, the most consensual criteria are generally those indicated in this option:
* "person under 25 years old",
* "man"
* "person lives in France"
* "person has a dog"

Even if a gesture has been made for the transparency of the targeting, Facebook is still far from a total transparency for its users.

### AdAnalyst

Patrick Loiseau, a researcher at "Laboratoire Informatique de Grenoble" in Grenoble, and his team have created a tool allowing users to obtain more transparency on the targeting and the data owned by Facebook about them.

This is a tool to add on your browser indicating:
* Data collected by Facebook on the user: interests, behaviors and demographics
* How advertisers target the user: what are the most used attributes (demographics, mobile data, interests)
* Calendar of all ads received by users with the attributes used for targeting

The tool is based on the attributes displayed by Facebook on the same ad by all AdAnalyst users.
So, as a user, I can see the different attributes related to the targeting of an advertisement I received.

In conclusion, the progress made in respect of privacy is diverse and is a major issue for the society in the coming years.
Some leads, such as the AdAnalyst tool, offer more transparency for targeting online ads and data accumulated by Facebook.

But business, like "Cambridge Analytica" where there's the suspicion of recovering Facebook data for political purposes, are a perfect example of tomorrow's society's issues.
